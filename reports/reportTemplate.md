# Senecan Trimeter in Humanist Tragedy

## Analysis

The scansions were generated for O. Zwierlein's 1986 edition of the Senecan plays and G. Grund's 2011 edition of the four Neo-Latin plays with the help of [anceps](https://github.com/Dargones/anceps), a Latin scansion tool specifically created for the purpose. We also accepted Padrin's emendations for *Ecerinis*  283, 353, and 508 as these changes allow these lines to be scanned.
$SCANSION_STATS$

For the in-depth analysis of the data and figures below, please refer to the paper. The following figures showcase the kind of information that can be extracted automatically from the scansion files thereby allowing further study of the material.

The first table shows how resolutions are distributed across the six feet of iambic trimeter in the fourteen texts in question. For each foot and play,  the table specifies what fraction of all resolutions in the play occur at that  foot.

| Play       | 1st foot | 2nd foot | 3rd foot | 4th foot | 5th foot | 6th foot |
| :--------- | :----    | :----    | :----    | :----    | :----    | :----    |
$RESOLUTION_TABLE$

The following table presents the same kind of information about elision rates.
Note that elisions are distributed almost uniformely in *Hiempsal*, a fact that
might explain the high elision rate in this play. (see next figure)

| Play       | 1st foot | 2nd foot | 3rd foot | 4th foot | 5th foot | 6th foot |
| :--------- | :----    | :----    | :----    | :----    | :----    | :----    |
$ELISION_TABLE$

The figure below compares the tragedies in question by elision frequency. The
outliers are *Hiempsal* and *Achilles*.

The final figure shows that resolution is on average more common in *antilabe*
than in monologues. For each play, the figure identifies the ratio of resolution
rates in lines with and without antilabe, a ratio that is higher than *1* for
all plays except *Achilles*.
